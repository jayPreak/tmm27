## Plan Output Format

**IMPORTANT: Output the training plan as structured JSON, then render to HTML.**

### Step 1: Write JSON Plan

Create a JSON file: `{event-name}-{date}.json`

Example: `ironman-703-oceanside-2026-03-29.json`

The JSON must follow the TrainingPlan schema.

**Inferring Unit Preferences:**

Determine the athlete's preferred units from their COROS data and event location:

| Indicator                                          | Likely Preference                            |
| -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| US-based events (Ironman Arizona, Boston Marathon) | Imperial: miles for bike/run, yards for swim |
| European/Australian events                         | Metric: km for bike/run, meters for swim     |
| COROS activities show distances in miles           | Imperial                                     |
| COROS activities show distances in km              | Metric                                       |
| Pool workouts in 25yd/50yd pools                   | Yards for swim                               |
| Pool workouts in 25m/50m pools                     | Meters for swim                              |

When in doubt, ask the athlete during validation. Use round distances that make sense in the chosen unit system:

- Metric: 5km, 10km, 20km, 40km, 80km (not 8.05km)
- Imperial: 3mi, 6mi, 12mi, 25mi, 50mi (not 4.97mi)
- Meters: 100m, 200m, 400m, 1000m, 1500m
- Yards: 100yd, 200yd, 500yd, 1000yd, 1650yd

**Week Scheduling:** Weeks must start on Monday or Sunday. Work backwards from race day to determine `planStartDate`.

**Durations must add up:** `durationMinutes` is the length of the whole session, warm-up and cool-down included. It is the number on the calendar card, in the workout detail and in the sidebar's hour totals, so it is what the athlete plans their day around. `humanReadable` describes that same session, so its parts must add up to `durationMinutes`: "10 min warm-up, 4x (3 min hard / 2 min easy), 10 min cool-down" is a 40-minute workout, not 30 and not 45. For parts given as a distance (a 1 mile warm-up, 5x1000m, a 2500m swim), count a realistic time at the prescribed pace. When you change a workout's length (scaling a week to its target hours, trimming a taper), change `durationMinutes` and `humanReadable` together, and keep the week's `targetHours` and `summary` in line with the new total.

### Step 2: Render to HTML

After writing the JSON file, render it to an interactive HTML viewer:

```bash
npx claude-coach render plan.json --output plan.html
```

This creates a beautiful, interactive training plan with:

- Calendar view with color-coded workouts by sport
- Click workouts to see full details
- Mark workouts as complete (saved to localStorage)
- Week summaries with hours by sport
- Dark mode, mobile responsive

### Step 3: Tell the User

After both files are created, tell the user:

1. The JSON file path (for data)
2. The HTML file path (for viewing)
3. Suggest opening the HTML file in a browser
